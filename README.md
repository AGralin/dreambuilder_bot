**Purpose of Project:** To identify when to buy, hold, and sell crypto using technical and sentiment analysis without being impacted by our emotions.

**Questions:**
- Which analysis is better to predict price movement for crypto: technical or sentiment? 
- Is there a way to identify a channel and break-outs?
- Which machine learning model will optimize the results?

**Data Collection:**
- Financial Data: Yahoo Finance and Alpaca Markets
- Sentiment Indicators: Fear and Greed, Pytrends, and Twitter
- Technical Indicators: Market Momentum, Hammer and Doji Candlesticks, Chaikin and ER, RSI, EMA, and Vortex. 

**Data Set:**

**Apply a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model:** Link: https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-dimensionality-reduction-article

- Use Decision Tree. It is one of dimensionality reduction techniques

**Machine Learning Models:**
- SVM
- MLPClassifier
- Logistic regression?
- XGBoost

**Results of Trained Models:**

**Prediction using New Sample Data:**

**Conclusion:**

**Requirements to Run Codes:**
- Python 3.8 version
- Alpaca Keys and env file
- Twitter account
