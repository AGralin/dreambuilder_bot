Project Proposal: 

Problem Statement: 
When to buy and sell based on technical and sentiment analysis? How to take the emotion out of the trades? 

Question we want to answer: 
Which is more important technical or sentiment analysis? 
How to identify channel and break out? 
Find a machine model that will optimize the results?

High level Action Items:
1.	Link to git branch: https://umn.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-Minnesota-Boot-Camp/UofM-VIRT-FIN-PT-09-2022-U-LOLC/-/tree/main/01-Sessions/08-Project-1/1/Activities/03-Stu_Branching-Pushing
2. API for Sentiment analysis (Adam and Faith)
3. Library for technical analysis (Yen)
4. API to get live data (Adam)
5. machine learning model for crypto (Yen)

How to consolidate all the info? 
2 main notebooks: sentiment (fear and greed and pytrend) vs. technical analysis vs.(technical analysis + pytrend)
machine learning model: neural network, xgb classifer using PCA, which feature we are using
Adam: run through machine learning, consolidate the sentiment one
Faith: run through neural network (class example)
Yen: consolidate technical and post. look at the neural netowork and xgb classifer
